My recent escapade led me to the world of XGBoost, where an upgraded version turned my doctest world upside down.

I was contributing to open source, at [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python), in an algorithm that uses XGBoost. Everything was running smoothly with the older version of XGBoost, until one day, it wasn't. Yep, you guessed it, the dreaded doctest started failing, and I was scratching my head wondering what went wrong.

I tried all the possible tricks up my sleeve to fix it, but no luck. You know how it is when you've been staring at code for hours, and it just won't cooperate. That's when I decided to take the leap and reach out to the [XGBoost community](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/9606) on GitHub. I mean, what's the harm, right?

### The GitHub SOS

I raised the issue in [XGBoost community](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/9606), explaining my woes and the mysterious doctest gremlins that were wreaking havoc on my code. The amazing members of the XGBoost community jumped in to lend a hand. It was like having a bunch of coding superheroes rush to the rescue!

With their guidance and expertise, we started digging into the issue. They made me go through the new features and changes in XGBoost 2.0.0, trying to figure out why my doctests were suddenly throwing a fit. It wasn't an easy task, but the community members were patient and supportive every step of the way.

### Unraveling XGBoost 2.0.0

As we delved deeper into the issue, we stumbled upon the changes related to the base score and automatically estimated intercepts in XGBoost 2.0.0. These were some pretty significant updates, and it got me thinking: could these changes be the culprits behind my doctest troubles?

With the community's help, we explored these changes in detail, discussing how they could impact existing code and doctests. The automatic base score estimation was causing some unexpected behavior in my algorithm.

### Solution-Finding

We found that the automatic base score estimation and the introduction of automatically estimated intercepts in XGBoost 2.0 were the key factors affecting my doctests, so, here's a brief overview:

1. **XGBoost:** XGBoost is a fast, accurate, and scalable machine-learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It works by building a series of decision trees and combining their predictions to produce a final prediction.
    
2. **Base Score in XGBoost 2.0.0:** In earlier versions, users set a constant value for the base\_score parameter. XGBoost 2.0.0 automates this process by estimating the base score from input labels, enhancing model accuracy from the get-go.
    
3. **Automatically Estimated Intercept:** XGBoost 2.0.0 introduces automatically estimated intercepts, eliminating the need for users to manually specify this value. It streamlines training and ensures that the intercept aligns with the dataset.
    

The automatic base score estimation conflicted with my doctests, which relied on manual base\_score settings.

### Lessons from the Journey

So, why am I sharing this story with you? Well, besides being a little adventure in the world of coding, it's a testament to the power of open-source communities and collaboration. When you hit a roadblock in your coding journey, don't be afraid to reach out, ask questions, and seek help. There's a whole community of developers out there ready to assist and share their knowledge.

Happy coding!
