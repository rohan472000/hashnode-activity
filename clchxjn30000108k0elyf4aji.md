# Dev Retro 2022,

In the daily life of Software Engineers, the only common friend is open-source websites or communities like stack overflow etc. These websites help us a lot when we are stuck alone with a problem. Thanks to all the open sources for being with us throughout every journey.

## Challenges and Lessons:-

### Challenge 1 (learning new techs and tools) -

At the start of 2022, I had to learn some techs and language to get allocated to projects, we got basic training for it but it was not enough to get started, so I took help from different open projects, tutorials and a few YouTube videos. Cleared my concepts through small projects, and get a hold of those techs and their tools.

**Lesson learned -&gt;** search more about that topic over which you want a hold of, and make some projects using that to test your skills.

**Achievement -&gt;** Learned those techs and tools within time and made projects to showcase my skills.

### Challenge 2 (lead a team for a new project) -

I was in my training phase, trying to make a small project with 4 member team, and the time was given as one month. I figured out the path or roadmap for the project and assigned roles to everyone with time limits.

The problem was the code that we wrote, the code was messy and needs to align with the aim, so I spent more time reviewing the codes and rectifying if there were errors.

The main problem was waiting for us at the deployment stage, but I figured out with different approach, I chose different platforms to host any application and tested each one of them, discussed with each member, and we proceeded with the best possible way.

**Lesson learned -&gt;** Discuss more with your team member to get new and unique ideas, ask them about other unconventional approaches also, talk about each other doubts and problems in accomplishing the task, and take responsibility if anything happens in the project.

**Achievement -&gt;** Our team was recognized as the best team because of our project out of six teams.

### Challenge 3 (Client interviews) -

Got a chance to get interviewed for a new role of data engineer, I had done a couple of projects and had good knowledge of some data engineering tools but the requirements for that role were slightly different from my expectation.

The time before my first interview, I spent more time learning that required techs and tools, made a small project with that techs to showcase my skill, and took the help of a senior in making some real-time projects also.

**Lesson learned -&gt;** Take the help of seniors, take some time before any interview to revise your strong and weak points if required then learn new techs also.

**Achievement -&gt;** Cleared all four rounds of interviews and got into the project successfully.

### Challenge 4 (Learn more out of interest) -

As for getting into any project, you need to focus on that particular field and its related techs but I got fascinated by some other techs also which I am not using in real-time but wanted to learn. With doing my work every day, I need to take out some time to learn that tech and to do hands-on.

I started to learn, got basic knowledge of it, and made errors, but got over them quickly. Then I made a small project with that tools and showed them to other mates, got appreciation from them, and now looking to make more projects and go deeper into it.

**Lesson learned -&gt;** Never limit yourself to fewer techs and tools, go and search out different tools and if that is fascinating then learn it.

**Achievement -&gt;** Learning new techs and making projects through them, and also indulging in research work.
