# Broken DAGs issue(Airflow)

### Introduction

In this blog, I'm going to point out one error that I used to encounter very often while scheduling DAGs and its solution, this blog will also give you a little insight into DAGs and Airflow.

**Note:-** I have installed Airflow through Docker Images, I'm using Apache Airflow 2.5.0 version so this solution should be working perfectly for 2.1.1+ versions of apache airflow, not sure for versions older than 2.1.1.

### Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Airflow's extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting with virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows.

### DAGs

DAGs. In Airflow, a DAG – or a **Directed Acyclic Graph** – is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies. A DAG is defined in a Python script, which represents the DAGs structure (tasks and their dependencies) as code.

### Broken DAGs

```python
Broken DAG: [/opt/airflow/dags/dag.py] Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/airflow/dags/dag.py", line 7, in <module>
    from training import training
  File "/opt/airflow/dags/training.py", line 6, in <module>
    from joblib import dump
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'joblib'
```

Here, I have installed the 'joblib' library in my virtualenv and also kept this lib in requirements.txt but still getting this error. Why????

Because your airflow isn't able to configure this library, to get it configured you need to specify this library in docker-compose.yml file inside the 'environment' tag under '\_PIP*\_*ADDITIONAL\_REQUIREMENTS: ${}'.

```python
_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: ${_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS:- joblib==1.2.0}
```

Download the docker-compose.yml file from here:- [docker-compose.ym](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml)l

For more information check this link:- [env-variables-docker-compose](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html)

after adding the library to the docker-compose.yml file you need to do below things:-

```python
docker-compose restart
```

if changes do not reflect by the above command then use the below command:-

```python
docker-compose up
```

This will install all the required python lib(S) along with Airflow services.
